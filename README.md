IF YOU KNOW YOU KNOW
TELL ME IF YOU WANNA RIDE
FASTER THAN A SPEED OF LIGHT
ONLY WE CAN GET IT RIGHT
(GET IT RIGHT GET IT RIGHT)
IF YOU KNOW YOU KNOW
TELL ME IF YOU WANNA RIDE
FASTER THAN A SPEED OF LIGHT
ONLY WE CAN GET IT RIGHT
(GET IT RIGHT GET IT RIGHT)
IF YOU KNOW YOU KNOW
I SEE IT IN YOUR EYES
DON'T WANNA FIGHT THIS FEELING
JUST LET IT OVERRIDE
FASTENED, WE LOCKED IN YEAH
LOOK WHERE THE STARS ALIGN
LIGHTS GLEAMING OFF THE CEILING
COME ON LET'S TAKE A RIDE
FAR BEYOND THE SKYLINES
ECSTATIC
LIGHT SPEED AUTOMATIC
WE DON'T DRIVE BY WE DIVE IN
ALL THE WAY DOWN THAT COSMIC DROP
LIKE LIKE LIKE WOAH STOP
LOVE IT WHEN YOU MAKE THAT BEAT ROCK
ROLLING WITH GALACTIC WOLVES
PUSH AND PULL
I'M A FREAK ON A BEAT LIKE UH
IF YOU'RE ASKING ME
WHERE I WANNA BE OH
SOMEWHERE OUT OF REACH
PLACE BEYOND MY DREAMS
IT'S ONE OF A KIND
OUT OF THIS TIME OH NA NA NA
BUT BABY ONLY IF YOU
IF YOU KNOW YOU KNOW
TELL ME IF YOU WANNA RIDE
FASTER THAN A SPEED OF LIGHT
ONLY WE CAN GET IT RIGHT
(GET IT RIGHT GET IT RIGHT)
IF YOU KNOW YOU KNOW
TELL ME IF YOU WANNA RIDE
FASTER THAN A SPEED OF LIGHT
ONLY WE CAN GET IT RIGHT
(GET IT RIGHT GET IT RIGHT)
IF YOU KNOW YOU KNOW
GLOBAL ASTRO VEHICLE
YEAH WE DO IT NONSTOP TO THE SAIKO
AND THAT MEANS 'TIL THE U-N-O IN U-F-O
BUT IF YOU KNEW MAYBE YOU WOULD KNOW?
EVERY PLANET I'M ON
IMMA DO WHAT I WANT
I DON'T TALK WHEN I WALK
SAY AND IT'S DONE
LIKE I ALREADY WON
SAYONARA I'M GONE
AH WOO SWOOSH
YEAH THAT'S FACTS
GIVE ME THAT BOOST
WITH A LIL BOUNCE BACK
HEY DO MY DANCEY DANCE
IF YOU COME AT MY GIRLS
IMMA THROW SOME HANDS LIKE
TAKE YOU TO OUTER-SPACE
WE MAKE IT LEVITATE
FLY THROUGH THE INTERSTATE
'CAUSE WE GO UP UP UP
YEAH WE ELEVATE
AND WE ATE LIKE A DINNER PLATE
IF YOU'RE ASKING ME
WHAT'S BEYOND THE DEEP OH
COME AND TAKE A LEAP
JUST FOLLOW MY LEAD
IT'S ONE OF A KIND
OUT OF THIS TIME OH NA NA NA
BUT BABY ONLY IF YOU
IF YOU KNOW YOU KNOW
TELL ME IF YOU WANNA RIDE
FASTER THAN A SPEED OF LIGHT
ONLY WE CAN GET IT RIGHT
(GET IT RIGHT GET IT RIGHT)
IF YOU KNOW YOU KNOW
TELL ME IF YOU WANNA RIDE
FASTER THAN A SPEED OF LIGHT
ONLY WE CAN GET IT RIGHT
(GET IT RIGHT GET IT RIGHT)
IF YOU KNOW YOU KNOW
TELL ME IF YOU WANNA RIDE
FASTER THAN A SPEED OF LIGHT
ONLY WE CAN GET IT RIGHT
(GET IT RIGHT GET IT RIGHT)
