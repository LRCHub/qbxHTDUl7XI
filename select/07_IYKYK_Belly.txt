The idea of you was my own reflection of distorted perception
Ether-ethereal ether wrapped inside my
Misdirection, missin' signs and red flags
Until you end
You end up on a missin' sign with your hair tied in a red, red rag
Just to reappear jet-lagged, lagged, yeah

Uh, when I was young, I made myself a promise
I said, "Only trust yourself, nobody else is honest"
Pay me dollars, not homage, I'm sick of bein' modest
Ironic, blessings came from somethin' so demonic
I got a million in diamonds inside the ultrasonic
Polished the flow, iconic, still, I'm so neurotic
I treat my product like narcotics, it's economics
Every stream like a fiend that wanna try the Chronic
The big tipper still tippin', outta town strippers (Yeah)
I bet these hoes go down quicker than brown liquor (Woah)
Hit my city at night, watchin' the lights flicker (Woah)
I'm gettin' high in the sky villa, my eyes swell up (My eyes swell up)

I'm tellin' time on the Skydweller
I keep my heart in the wine cellar, I try to tell 'em
Thoughts of you give my body chills, my only pleasure
I think I know a diamond feel, I'm under pressure
Thirty pounds in the hefty, I hope the Lord bless me (Lord)
My pimp hand ambidextrous, don't make me go lefty (Bitch)
Maybe I'm hard to understand, but these hoes get me (Yeah)
I ball hard, I should've got my own espy

My heart cold, I swear it feel like 50 below ('Low)
I don't let the pain show
If you know, you know (If you know, you know)
Man, you used to be my dawg, but we don't kick it no more (You know)
I still got love for you
If you know, you know (If you know, you know)
My OG servin' ten, he said, "The time movin' slow"
You gon' be rich when you home, if you know, you know
(You know, if you know, you know)
And she could be your dream girl, to someone else, she a ho (Yeah)
That's just how the game go, if you know, you know (Yeah)

If you know, you know (You know, yeah)
I told her, "If you know, you know"
You know the vibes, bitch (Uh, yeah)
If you know, you know (You know)
I told her, "If you know, you know"
You know the vibes, bitch (Alright)

Vicious, how you still around the same bitches? (How?)
Got they nose in my business, call it cocaine interest
Heaven, Hell, it's the same distance
Cold like the Winter solstice that became Christmas (Cold)
Uh, new decors, millions in my floorboards, money walk
Villains line the walls in the corridor, no remorse (Nah)
Before money, I been rich
Whippin' 'til the shit made my limbs
Twitch, the zombies came back with the skin itch
Thriller live, faces like Vanilla Sky (Ah)
Almost had to die just to feel alive
They can't fill the size or walk a
Mile in these Margielas slides (Slides)
The revolution won't be televised
Nights become days (Days), I made it out of Hell unscathed
Might go back one day, just to sunbathe
One way, high beams on (Haha), doin' top speed
Cold world, long as we alive we are not free (Uh)

All alone, if I'm alive, I'm not me
All alone, if I'm alive, I'm not free
You know the vibes, bitch
