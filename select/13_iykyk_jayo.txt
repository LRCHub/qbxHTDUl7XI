I remember being 16
Big dreams
Pulling up to parties like a
Big screen
Quick fling
Now we twenty something and I still think bout all the good things
Tell me if you still think bout all the good things
Cuz i know the memories, jokes and the deepest stories that me hide on the low is where we keep it
If you know you know
Ahh
Don’t bother if you don’t
Secrets that we own
Ahh
We’ll save them till we’re ghost
Cuz we all got moments we don’t post and we cherish those the most
If you know you know
Ahh
Don’t bother if you don’t
Keep your secret like a message in a bottle
Won’t tell your parents that thing in Colorado
Polaroids and Gucci slides we looking like some models
Yea we looking like some models
Live like we don’t know what the future holds
Making memories that we can’t let go
I’ve been trying to
Tryna let you know
Damn it’s impossible
If you know you know
Ahh
Don’t bother if you don’t
Secrets that we own
Ahh
We’ll save them till we’re ghost
Cuz we all got moments we don’t post and we cherish those the most
If you know you know
Ahh
Don’t bother if you don’t
Don’t bother if you don’t
Don’t bother if you don’t
Don’t bother if you don’t
Don’t bother if you don’t
Cuz we all got moments we don’t post and we cherish those the most
If you know you know
Ahh
Don’t bother if you don’t
If you know you know
Ahh
Don’t bother if you don’t
